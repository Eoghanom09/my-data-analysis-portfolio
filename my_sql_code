i used a very simple SQL code for this project.
this code helped me find the top ten country's in europe with the highest healthy life expectancy.

SELECT
  Country_name, 
  Healthy_life_expectancy 
FROM
  `coursework-411813.europe.europe_life_expectancy`
ORDER BY
  Healthy_life_expectancy DESC;
LIMIT 10
